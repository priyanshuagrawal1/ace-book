## Description

Acebook is a social media platform developed using React.js and Firebase. It allows users to connect and share their thoughts, photos, and experiences with friends and followers. With Acebook, users can create an account, log in, and set up their profile by adding a profile photo. They can then create posts, consisting of images and captions, to share with their network. Users can also like and comment on posts from their friends, fostering engagement and interaction within the community.

The project ensures a responsive user interface by leveraging the power of React.js. It allows users to seamlessly navigate and interact with the platform across various devices and screen sizes. Firebase is integrated into Acebook for authentication, storage, and real-time data synchronization, providing a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.
